## Abstention and Confidence Guidelines

### Confidence Thresholds

```
Confidence Levels:
- High (90-100%): Proceed with analysis
- Medium (70-89%): Proceed with caution, note uncertainty
- Low (50-69%): Request human review
- Very Low (<50%): Abstain completely

Abstention Triggers:
- Unclear document type
- Missing critical information
- Conflicting data
- Ambiguous field values
- Incomplete documents
```

### Abstention Responses

```
When abstaining, use these standardized responses:

Classification: "IDK/needs human review"
Field Extraction: null or "IDK"
Compliance: "IDK/insufficient data"
Analysis: "IDK/requires human review"

Always provide reasoning for abstention:
- "Confidence too low"
- "Insufficient data"
- "Conflicting information"
- "Ambiguous content"
```

## Error Handling Prompts

### Error Recovery Prompt

```
If analysis fails or produces unexpected results:

1. Check document quality and readability
2. Verify field extraction accuracy
3. Confirm rule application correctness
4. Validate JSON response format
5. Ensure all required fields present

Error Response Format:
{
  "error": "description",
  "confidence": "low",
  "requires_human": true,
  "partial_results": {...}
}
```

## Quality Assurance Prompts

### Validation Prompt

```
Validate the analysis results before returning:

1. JSON format is valid
2. All required fields present
3. Field formats correct (UEI 12 chars, DUNS 9 digits)
4. Rule citations accurate
5. Confidence levels appropriate
6. No PII in responses
7. Professional tone maintained

If validation fails, return error with details.
```

4. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement mechanisms
5. **Monitoring**: Track prompt performance

## Testing and Validation

### Prompt Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual prompt testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end prompt validation
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary condition testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Failure case validation
